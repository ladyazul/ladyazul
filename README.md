Decided to make one for ponytown
- U may copy any of my ponies idc . love for all.
- I'm usually in the "Pokemon area" on the 18+ server, I play on the safe server sometimes too.
- If we hit it off u may ask for my discord!
- I might be off tab either working on a project (unlikely) or doing school work (more likely) so  whisper if it's important.
- My interests are: **pokemon**, dbd, blazblue, and twewy. There's more, but I can talk about these for *hours*, esp pokemon.
- no dni, but I tend to hide those who are openly pro/darkshippers and make me uneasy. Which is a majority of them.  Sorry
